# OpenID Connect middleware for Echo (v4)

This middleware is in alpha stage and should not yet be used for production. It is heavily inspired by the [JWT middleware](https://github.com/labstack/echo/blob/master/middleware/jwt.go).

## Tests

Tests will be added when the [dispans](https://github.com/XenitAB/dispans) library is ready to be used. Look at the dispans examples for how to use it.
